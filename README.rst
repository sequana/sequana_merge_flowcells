Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

You must install Sequana first::

    pip install sequana

Then, just install this package::

    pip install sequana_merge_flowcells


Usage
~~~~~

::

    sequana_pipelines_merge_flowcells --help
    sequana_pipelines_merge_flowcells --input-directory DATAPATH 

This creates a directory with the pipeline and configuration file. You will then need 
to execute the pipeline::

    cd merge_flowcells
    sh merge_flowcells.sh  # for a local run

This launch a snakemake pipeline. If you are familiar with snakemake, you can 
retrieve the pipeline itself and its configuration files and then execute the pipeline yourself with specific parameters::

    snakemake -s merge_flowcells.rules -c config.yaml --cores 4 --stats stats.txt

Or use `sequanix <https://sequana.readthedocs.io/en/master/sequanix.html>`_ interface.

Details
~~~~~~~~~

This pipeline runs **merge_flowcells** in parallel on the input fastq files (paired or not). 
A brief sequana summary report is also produced.


Rules and configuration details
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here is the `latest documented configuration file <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sequana/sequana_merge_flowcells/master/sequana_pipelines/merge_flowcells/config.yaml>`_
